I am a Financial Economist at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. My interests span labor economics, finance, and networks, and my research uses both theoretical and empirical approaches to understand how social interactions shape aggregate outcomes. My supervision work includes evaluating models designed to detect money laundering, and screening bank lending for violations of fair lending laws such as redlining.
