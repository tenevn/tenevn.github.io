I am a Financial Economist at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, where I evaluate models designed to detect money laundering and screen bank lending for violations of fair lending laws such as redlining. My research interests span labor economics, finance, and networks, and my work employs both theoretical and empirical approaches to understand how social interactions shape aggregate outcomes.
