<b>Voting and Social Pressure Under Imperfect Information</b> (with [Alexander Clark](https://sites.google.com/site/alexanderthclark/)) <br>
[International Economic Review, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/iere.12401) <br>
We develop a model in which costly voting in a large two-party election is a sequentially rational choice of strategic, self-interested players who can reward fellow voters by forming stronger ties in a network formation coordination game. The predictions match a variety of stylized facts, including explaining why an individual's voting behavior may depend on what she knows about her friends' actions. Players have imperfect information about others' voting behavior, and we find that some degree of privacy may actually be necessary for voting in equilibrium, enabling hypocritical but useful social pressure. Our framework applies to any costly prosocial behavior.

<b>Social Connections and Racial Wage Inequality</b> <br>
[latest draft May 2020](https://osf.io/vm82w/) <br>
How much of the wage gap between black workers and others in the US owes to differences in jobs found through social connections? Panel data from the NLSY79 are used to estimate a job search model in which individual human capital is distinguished from social capital by comparing the wages and frequency of jobs found directly with those of jobs found through friends. Jobs found through friends tend to pay more, but this premium is lower for black workers; the difference can account for 10% of the racial wage gap.

<b>Coordinated Shirking</b> <br>
[latest draft November 2018](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/264vt/) <br>
In the financial crisis of 2008, losses on popular new securitized products far exceeded predictions. This paper studies this episode with a model of technology adoption: a principal tries to induce costly effort from a group of agents charged with vetting new technology. The principal is unwilling to simultaneously punish large groups of agents, so they shirk when coordination is possible. Widely applicable technology expands productive possibilities but also provides an opportunity for coordinated shirking, and can thus lead to widespread production failure. Furthermore, even agents who learn that they are using flawed technology may continue to do so.
