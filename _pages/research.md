<b>Voting and Social Pressure Under Imperfect Information</b> (with [Alexander Clark](https://sites.google.com/site/alexanderthclark/)) <br>
[International Economic Review, 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/iere.12401) <br>
We develop a model in which costly voting in a large two-party election is a sequentially rational choice of strategic, self-interested players who can reward fellow voters by forming stronger ties in a network formation coordination game. The predictions match a variety of stylized facts, including explaining why an individual's voting behavior may depend on what she knows about her friends' actions. Players have imperfect information about others' voting behavior, and we find that some degree of privacy may actually be necessary for voting in equilibrium, enabling hypocritical but useful social pressure. Our framework applies to any costly prosocial behavior.

<b>Optimal Echo Chambers</b> (with [Gabriel Martinez](https://gabriel-martinez-roa.github.io/))<br>
[latest draft December 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01249) <br>
We show that echo chambers are a rational response to uncertain information quality, and that broadening the range of views someone is exposed to can make their beliefs both less accurate and less responsive to the views of others. A Bayesian decision maker draws a signal about the (real-valued) state of the world from a collection of unbiased sources of heterogeneous quality. We show that exclusively sampling signals close to the prior expectation can improve accuracy, as they are more likely high quality. Signals close to the prior expectation can move beliefs further than more contrary views; the ability to ignore those with opposing beliefs makes one more responsive to others' views, since it increases their perceived accuracy. The optimal echo chamber balances the credibility of views similar to one's own against the usefulness of those further away. 

<b>Social Connections and Racial Wage Inequality</b> <br>
[latest draft May 2020](https://osf.io/vm82w/) *(previously titled [Social Capital and Racial Inequality](https://sites.google.com/site/nicholastenev/tenev_JMP.pdf))* <br>
How much of the wage gap between black workers and others in the US owes to differences in jobs found through social connections? Panel data from the NLSY79 are used to estimate a job search model in which individual human capital is distinguished from social capital by comparing the wages and frequency of jobs found directly with those of jobs found through friends. Jobs found through friends tend to pay more, but this premium is lower for black workers; the difference can account for 10% of the racial wage gap.

<b>Coordinated Shirking</b> <br>
[latest draft November 2018](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/264vt/) <br>
In the financial crisis of 2008, losses on popular new securitized products far exceeded predictions. This paper studies this episode with a model of technology adoption: a principal tries to induce costly effort from a group of agents charged with vetting new technology. The principal is unwilling to simultaneously punish large groups of agents, so they shirk when coordination is possible. Widely applicable technology expands productive possibilities but also provides an opportunity for coordinated shirking, and can thus lead to widespread production failure. Furthermore, even agents who learn that they are using flawed technology may continue to do so.
